Reason for this improvements are related to the following lesson learned:\n\n•Single lift operation for metrology equipment deployment – 8 lifts in total.\n•Lift carried out with unprotected equipment (no Basket) – resulted in damage to one Compatt. \n•Poor HPR ROV positioning made tether management difficult\n•Sharp edges on metrology equipment made damage to ROV tether\n•Lack of ROV positioning dis also resulted in extended operational time",

Pulling the bit above the float collar and into the larger diameter casing prior to flow checking could decrease the risk of getting stuck.\n",
